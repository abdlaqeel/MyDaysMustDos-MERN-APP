README for My Day's Must Do's Application

<h1> My Day's Must Do's</h1>
This is a full stack application made by using MERN stack- MangoDB, Express, React and NodeJS. I created this application to increase my knowledge of MERN stack and get a real time experience of building a full stack application. The complete back end and front end of this application was built from scratch. 

<h1>How to Access the Application?</h1>

1. Download the code and extract the data from .zip file.
2. Use terminal to navigate to the server folder and run the MangoDB server by command ``npm start``.
3. Use terminal to navigate to the client folder and run the React front end by command ``npm start``.
4. Go to ``localhost:3000/?`` in the browser to access the web application.
